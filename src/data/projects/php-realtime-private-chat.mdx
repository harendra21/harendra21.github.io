# PHP Realtime Private Chat

**Realtime-One-To-One-Chat** is an open-source project, designed to facilitate real-time, private one-to-one chat functionality using PHP and WebSockets. The application leverages the Ratchet library for WebSocket communication and AngularJS for the frontend interface.

-   **One-to-One Chat**: Supports private conversations between two users, ensuring direct and secure communication.
    
-   **AngularJS Frontend**: Employs AngularJS to create a responsive and dynamic user interface.
    
-   **Database Integration**: Stores user socket IDs in a MySQL database to manage active connections and message routing.
    
-   **Open Source**: Released under the MIT License, allowing developers to freely use, modify, and distribute the software.
